4-08 : Observation room
     Notes and books fill the room. Subjects in room 4-07 are
     observed through this room. A double barred door leads from
     this room into a small cell with a one way window peering

     The secret door as imperceptible viewing slots to see if there
     is anyone in the room.

     drapery.

     This is also filled with notes.

     The observation cell is a magicked viewing portal. The
     holding room side looks like a plain, stone wall. It is
     magicked to not show any magic dweomer. Only a roll of 01
     will hint the slightly magical aura.

     The door to the other secret door is behind a desk that 
     rotates. The secret door has impercptible viewing slots
     to see if there might be anything on the other side of the door.
