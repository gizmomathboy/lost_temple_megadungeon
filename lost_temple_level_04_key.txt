     one way window. Looks out into the foyer
     polished stone

4-03 : foyer, large quartz doors opposite the bronze
     most creatures on this level can't get through the quartz
     doors
     Stepping out into the hallway causes a magic mouth to activate:
     "Welcome to the Collection, we hope you enjoy your stay"
     This alerts the bodyguards, assistants, and mad scientist to 
     the presence of someone coming from above

4-08 : Observation room
     Notes and books fill the room. Subjects in room 4-07 are
     observed through this room. A double barred door leads from
     this room into a small cell with a one way window peering
     into room 4-07.

     The secret door as imperceptible viewing slots to see if there
     is anyone in the room.

4-09 : Holding room
     Test subjects are placed with the room. Locked and barred
     door is the only way in or out. Various methods of restraints
     are found in the room

4-10 : Secret Observation room
     A secret door from 4-06 leads to this room. Once in the room
     the door back to the main Observation room is behind a book
     case. The door to the secret observation cell is behind a 
     drapery.

     This is also filled with notes.

     The observation cell is a magicked viewing portal. The
     holding room side looks like a plain, stone wall. It is
     magicked to not show any magic dweomer. Only a roll of 01
     will hint the slightly magical aura.

     The door to the other secret door is behind a desk that 
     rotates. The secret door has impercptible viewing slots
     to see if there might be anything on the other side of the door.

4-11 : Science lab
       A variety of glassware along with vivisection equipment is located
       here. There are 3-18 potions under construction here. There is 1
       2:6 chance it is complete enough to be useful.

       There are also 4-32 scrolls in various states of work as well.
       1:6 chance of being useful

4-12 : Science lab stores
       Everything a growing mad scientist needs to make most any potion
       or scroll, or hideous abomination to magic.

4-14 : Mad Scientist library
       A lot of books, some are magical

4-15 : an NPC party is renting this and the adjoining spaces
       They are mostly using it as a resting spot for the
       rest of the dungeon. They will match the strength of the
       party exploring this space.

       In Greyhawk they are 50% likely to be from the Scarlet 
       Brotherhood

       Rent is high from the Mad Scientist on this level. it
       is 1K gp per person per month. Mostly because the door
       has similar magic as 4-03. No monsters can get in.

       Plus the door is wizard locked by the Mad Scientist and
       he regulary changes the passphrase

4-16 : holds the non-useful loot from 4-15

4-17 : an invisible chest holds the dearest loot and secrets from
       the party in 4-15

4-18 : cells holding abomintations to magic. Current experiments here
       are:
         superior albino ape: trying to reprogram its brain
         superior albino ape/scorpion cross: second arms have stingers
             for hands
         superior albino ape/squid: tentacles for arms, no sentience
             left
         lizard man: awaiting inspiration
         grimlock  : just messing with it, trying to understand it

4-40 : Locker room - placard above it in alien script
          If deciphered it reads: Home of the Flargots

4-41 : Locker room - placard above it in alient script
          If deciphered it reads: Visitors

4-42 : mess hall
       produces food and beverages by advanced science
       not quite enough food to feed both grimlock factions
       they can only get it to make water and a twinky like
       confection. It doesn't understand words for much food
       that didn't exist in the time of the ancient race/hyperboreans

4-65 : mass teleporter to other places
       might be able to decipher controls to send things
       to other hyperborean planets
       Can reach any part of the hyperborean/ancient ones
       empire

       The dotted line is the force field the separates what
       will be transport versus what won't. It is also a 
       visible sign on the floor and ceiling

       Darker circle is teleport zone. Controls and displays outside
       the dotted circle

4-65A: area that controls to teleportation device are located

4-66 : opening into mining area there might be random mining equipment
       present.

       There is a chance that a grimlock or ape man party will be in this
       room of the mining tunnels

       The ancient ones were mining a stable, non-radiaton poisoning version
       of glowing diamond. Identical to the glowing, green diamonds found
       in the diamond desert (see Ghost Ship of the Desert Dunes) but without
       the side effects.

       A co-existing mineral is a very hard metal analogous to adamantium/mithril.
       Can be forged by dwarves into magnificent items (+3 or better weapons/armor).
       Very light and tough. Basically anything made with it gives a +3 or better
       beneficial bonus. Like if a summoning/magic circle is made with it, the
       summoner gets +3 or better on saves dealing with summoned creatures.

       However, there is a 5% chance during creating the mineral gets poisoned and
       the beneficial bonus becomes a detrimental bonus (-3 instead of +3). One
       doesn't know it's poisoned until the item is used.
