Construction notes:
 - temple to skarl (temp marked as 3-1)
     non devotees of Skarl need to make a save vs something or act as if Slowed. 
     The weapon of choice for the acolytes are big ass drum sticks.

     The temple is a pair of raised platforms. The first is about 5' above floor level with stairs up to it. 
     The second is maybe 10 feet about the first with a ladder up. 
     On that is a person drumming away to help Skarl keep MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI slumbering with drumming. 
     There will be other drummers at the corners of the first platform but the Important One is at the top.

     Woe be the person that disturbs any of these drummers, nevermind trying to get to the top.
   
 - trapped demons and devils, maybe even a modron (temp marked as 3-2)
   They are look the same and try to convince anyone in the room to break their circle and
   set them free

 - temple for something (temp marked as 3-3)
     There is a hall of statues but I can't recall what they mean.
     maybe statues of the shapes of the true god
