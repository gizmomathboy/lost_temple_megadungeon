Construction notes:
   
 - trapped demons and devils, maybe even a modron (temp marked as 3-2)
   They are look the same and try to convince anyone in the room to break their circle and set them free

   There is a lectern with 5 gem set in it. Each is worth 5,000 GP.

   The are set in what looks to be a reproduction of the layout of the
   room. Removing a gem activates/deactivates the power of a circle.

   Without a gem of equal or greater value of the same type the circle
   won't work.

 - temple for something (temp marked as 3-3)
     There is a hall of statues but I can't recall what they mean.
     maybe statues of the shapes of the true god

        disturb their enhanced slumber.

03-04 : large bed and shrine
        There is a mural of the sky in the "north" side. If roll 4d6
        under Wisdom then you can notice the clouds or whatever
        part of the mural that could move does. It is very, very, very
        small movements.
        
        The altar has a fresco of a human looking person with a glow
        about them sleeping on a bed or large pillows. On the other side
        is another glowing human looking person. They appearing to be
        drumming.

        Sleeping on the bed gives a peaceful and serene sleep. Getting
        a full night's rest in but 1 hour. Sleeping for 8 hours is like
        resting for a week. For every one of rest taken the bed can not
        be used by that person for the same number of days.

03-05 : Temple to Skarl
     non devotees of Skarl need to make a save vs something or act as if Slowed. 
     The weapon of choice for the acolytes are big ass drum sticks.

     The temple is a pair of raised platforms. The first is about 5' above floor level with stairs up to it. 
     The second is maybe 10 feet about the first with a ladder up. 
     On that is a person drumming away to help Skarl keep He Who Must MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI slumbering with drumming. 
     There will be other drummers at the corners of the first platform but the Important One is at the top.

     Woe be the person that disturbs any of these drummers, nevermind trying to get to the top.

03-28 : filled with glowing embers, Room of Habaniah

03-29 : Books of Roon: Filled with books stacked on each other in
        no discernable order

03-30 : temple of kib, sender of life

03-31 : treasure: healing pistol, like radium pistol but heals instead
        of causing damage. It has 1d12+12 charges, it heals 5d6 hp per
        hit.

03-32 : sarcophagus of curing
        Carvings on the side with Kib in the middle. To the left are
        figures looking like they're lying down. On the other side
        they are standing.

        On top is a large carving of Kib

03-33 : maze entrance
        anti-magic field inside it
        walls can't be chipped or worn or mined

        Written at the maze entrance in various magic languages:

        "So it was written in the Book of Trogool, from where it was
        stolen did Roon the Going find it and place it here."

        High level spell casters will feel magic drain from there 
        thoughts when they enter the maze. It should return upon 
        exit (roll vs. know spell). This includes learning from
        the potion rooms unless that was written down

03-34 : "Be wary of the knowledge stolen from the Book of Roon"

03-35 : Room of potions
        A spell caster of high enough level can read the magic
        writings on these walls to be able identify any potion
        by sight and smell and such.

        It is subtle but noticeable that it does mention that poisons
        can be disguised as a "potion". Roll 4d6 under INT/WIS whichever
        is relevant to the caster

        It will take at least a week of study to decipher and 
        understand

03-36 : Room of pills
        Like room of potions

03-37 : Room of oils
        Like room of potions

03-38 : Room of unguents and other preparations
        Like room of potions

03-39 : room of comfortable relaxations
        chairs, divans, couches

03-40 : Hall of the Magic Item Transmogrifier
        atop a 3 foot high platform is a transparent box
        It's indestructible.
        Side panels slide to the right. As they slide the
        end doesn't stick out past the edge but looks to
        disappear.

        This converts a magic item from one form to a similar
        form.

        For example, if a +1 dagger is first placed into it
        and then a short sword along with a 1,000 GP or higher
        gem (or a special stone) after the door is closed the
        dagger and gem/stone disappear and the short sword is
        transformed into a +1 weapon.

        This will not work with sentient items or artifacts.

        Rings can become cloaks, etc but DM judgement is supreme.

        The first time the room is visited there might be a magic
        item already in the box. 
        
        10% chance of this.
          If there is an item it is 90% likely to beneficial to the
          person entering the room.

          For example, if a dwarven cleric first steps into the room
          a mace of disruption might be in the box.

03-43 : Hall of the Undead
        At any moment there are d100 undead roaming this area. They
        will be evenly distributed throughout the hall unless an
        event causes them to mass together.
