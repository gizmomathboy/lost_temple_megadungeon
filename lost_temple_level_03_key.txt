Construction notes:
   
 - trapped demons and devils, maybe even a modron (temp marked as 3-2)
   They are look the same and try to convince anyone in the room to break their circle and
   set them free

 - temple for something (temp marked as 3-3)
     There is a hall of statues but I can't recall what they mean.
     maybe statues of the shapes of the true god

Rooms

03-01 : There is writing 

        Be respectful of the sleeping.
        Honor the pious.

03-02 : moldy, rotting cloth on shelves

03-03 : leads to spyhole into room 03-04 
        2 eye holes at normal human height.
        Used to view those taking an extended rest so as to not
        disturb their enhanced slumber.

03-04 : large bed and shrine
        There is a mural of the sky in the "north" side. If roll 4d6
        under Wisdom then you can notice the clouds or whatever
        part of the mural that could move does. It is very, very, very
        small movements.
        
        The altar has a fresco of a human looking person with a glow
        about them sleeping on a bed or large pillows. On the other side
        is another glowing human looking person. They appearing to be
        drumming.

        Sleeping on the bed gives a peaceful and serene sleep. Getting
        a full night's rest in but 1 hour. Sleeping for 8 hours is like
        resting for a week. For every one of rest taken the bed can not
        be used by that person for the same number of days.

03-05 : Temple to Skarl
     non devotees of Skarl need to make a save vs something or act as if Slowed. 
     The weapon of choice for the acolytes are big ass drum sticks.

     The temple is a pair of raised platforms. The first is about 5' above floor level with stairs up to it. 
     The second is maybe 10 feet about the first with a ladder up. 
     On that is a person drumming away to help Skarl keep He Who Must MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI slumbering with drumming. 
     There will be other drummers at the corners of the first platform but the Important One is at the top.

     Woe be the person that disturbs any of these drummers, nevermind trying to get to the top.
